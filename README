This is my first plugin, so I expect there to be some mistakes. 
Comments or suggestions are welcome.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup:
-Required
--jQuery 1.4.4+
--jCarousel 0.2.8

Copy graph.css and jcarousel_skin.css into your css directory. (Adjust image paths as needed)
Copy /graph, /jcarousel, and /metrics into your images directory

On the page you wish to use the animated graph on, create an empty div and point the plugin at it.
$('benchmark').graph()

Pass objects in just like anyother jQuery plugin.
  $('benchmark').graph({
    jsonScript: "/controls/benchmark.php", 
    ajaxData: {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'} 
  });
